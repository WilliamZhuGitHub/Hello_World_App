# Chat Application
## Description
A chat application that can randomly pair its users.
 
## Deliverables
We will allow users to make an account and be paired up with other users who are also on the network.
We are going to use Java to create a client-server architecture. The server will be pairing those on the network together. We use socket programmingfor the communication between client and server.

## Features
1. Server will be able to pair clients that are online.
2. Users will be able to create an account. 
3. Conversations can be archived.
